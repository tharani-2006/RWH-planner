# üß† Algorithms Used in RWH-Erode Project

## üéØ Overview of All Algorithms

This project uses **6 main types of algorithms** working together like a team of experts. Each algorithm has a specific job to make the system smart and accurate.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithms

### **1. Random Forest Classifier (Structure Selection)**
**What it does:** Decides whether to build a pit, trench, or shaft

**How it works:**
- Looks at 8 different factors: soil type, space shape, groundwater depth, etc.
- Has learned from 1,500 different scenarios
- Makes decision by "voting" - like asking 100 experts and taking majority opinion
- **Accuracy: 98%**

**Simple Example:**
```
Input: Sandy soil + 3m√ó8m space + 5m groundwater depth
Algorithm thinks:
- Tree 1 says: "Trench" (long narrow space)
- Tree 2 says: "Trench" (good for sandy soil)  
- Tree 3 says: "Trench" (safe depth)
- 87 out of 100 trees vote "Trench"
Result: Recommend Recharge Trench
```

### **2. Neural Network (Dimension Prediction)**
**What it does:** Calculates exact length, width, and depth

**How it works:**
- Has 3 layers of "artificial brain cells"
- Each layer processes information and passes to next layer
- Learns patterns from thousands of successful installations
- **Accuracy: R¬≤ = 0.978 (very high)**

**Simple Example:**
```
Input Layer: [roof_area=150, family=5, space=24m¬≤]
Hidden Layer: Processes relationships between inputs
Output Layer: [length=4m, width=3m, depth=2.5m]
```

### **3. Gradient Boosting (Volume Calculation)**
**What it does:** Predicts how much water the structure can handle

**How it works:**
- Starts with a simple guess
- Finds mistakes in the guess
- Makes a better guess to fix mistakes
- Repeats 100 times to get very accurate answer
- **Accuracy: R¬≤ = 0.935**

**Simple Example:**
```
Guess 1: 15,000 liters (too low)
Mistake: -5,000 liters
Guess 2: 20,000 liters (still low)
Mistake: -2,000 liters
Guess 3: 22,000 liters (perfect!)
```

## üßÆ Mathematical Algorithms

### **4. Water Collection Formula (Hydrological Calculation)**
**What it does:** Calculates how much rainwater you can collect

**The Formula:**
```
Annual Collection = Roof Area √ó Annual Rainfall √ó Runoff Coefficient √ó Roof Efficiency

Where:
- Roof Area = your roof size in m¬≤
- Annual Rainfall = 775mm for Erode
- Runoff Coefficient = 0.8 (20% is lost to evaporation)
- Roof Efficiency = 0.95 for concrete, 0.75 for mud
```

**Step-by-step Example:**
```
Step 1: Base calculation
150m¬≤ √ó 775mm √ó 0.8 = 93,000 liters

Step 2: Apply roof efficiency  
93,000 √ó 0.95 (concrete roof) = 88,350 liters

Step 3: Apply location factor
88,350 √ó 1.1 (Erode factor) = 97,185 liters per year
```

### **5. Space Optimization Algorithm (Geometric Analysis)**
**What it does:** Finds the best way to use your available space

**The Logic:**
```
1. Calculate space area = length √ó width
2. Calculate aspect ratio = max(length,width) / min(length,width)
3. Apply decision rules:

If area < 4m¬≤:
    ‚Üí Recommend Shaft (vertical solution)
Else if aspect_ratio > 3:
    ‚Üí Recommend Trench (fits long narrow space)  
Else:
    ‚Üí Recommend Pit (best for square spaces)
```

**Example:**
```
Space: 12m √ó 2m
Area: 24m¬≤ (good size)
Aspect Ratio: 12/2 = 6 (very long and narrow)
Decision: Trench is perfect for this shape
```

### **6. Cost Optimization Algorithm (Economic Analysis)**
**What it does:** Calculates the most cost-effective solution

**The Process:**
```
Step 1: Base cost calculation
Material Cost = Volume √ó Cost_per_m¬≥
Labor Cost = Volume √ó Labor_rate √ó Soil_difficulty

Step 2: Apply multipliers
Soil Multiplier:
- Sandy: 1.0x (easy to dig)
- Clayey: 1.5x (hard to dig)  
- Rocky: 2.0x (very hard to dig)

Space Multiplier:
- Large space (>25m¬≤): 1.0x
- Medium space (10-25m¬≤): 1.1x
- Small space (<10m¬≤): 1.3x (difficult access)

Step 3: Final calculation
Total Cost = (Material + Labor) √ó Soil √ó Space √ó 1.2 (contingency)
```

## üéØ Decision Tree Algorithms

### **7. Goal-Based Routing Algorithm**
**What it does:** Chooses different paths based on user's goal

**The Decision Tree:**
```
User Goal?
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Storage & Reuse
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Space Available?
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rooftop only ‚Üí Tank System
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ground space ‚Üí Underground Tank
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Calculate: Daily usage √ó 30 days storage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Artificial Recharge  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Soil Type?
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandy ‚Üí Pit (fast infiltration)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clayey ‚Üí Trench (more surface area)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rocky ‚Üí Shaft (deep penetration)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Calculate: Annual rainfall √ó collection area
```

### **8. Safety Check Algorithm**
**What it does:** Makes sure the recommendation is safe and legal

**The Checks:**
```
1. Groundwater Depth Check:
   If depth < 3m ‚Üí Warning: Risk of contamination
   
2. Soil Stability Check:
   If soil = "Very Rocky" ‚Üí Increase cost by 100%
   
3. Space Feasibility Check:
   If required_area > available_area ‚Üí Suggest alternative
   
4. Budget Reality Check:
   If cost > ‚Çπ5,00,000 ‚Üí Suggest smaller system
```

   - Verify household size (1-50 people)
   - Validate space dimensions

2. Data Normalization:

   - Compute collection efficiency
```

### **10. Recommendation Ranking Algorithm**
**What it does:** Ranks multiple options and picks the best one

**The Scoring System:**
```
For each possible solution, calculate score:

Score = (Efficiency √ó 0.3) + (Cost_effectiveness √ó 0.3) + 
        (Space_utilization √ó 0.2) + (Maintenance_ease √ó 0.2)

Where each factor is scored 0-100:
- Efficiency: How much water it collects
- Cost effectiveness: Value for money
- Space utilization: How well it fits your space  
- Maintenance ease: How easy to maintain

Pick the solution with highest score!
```
